        <p>Don your armor on and grab your weapons!</p>
        <br>
        <p>When you create a character there are some things you can do to help ensure your character fits into the adventure. Not just in the sense of someone who belongs (we cover that in Backstory Creation) but in the sense of someone who doesn’t get frustrated with their abilities or class choices because they don’t work well with the adventure.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Remember, the goal here isn't to ruin your fun, or tell you no. It's to make sure all players come to the table with proper characters ready to tackle the adventure ahead. Ensuring everyone has a fun time. To be blunt, a character idea or concept you have and want to play, might not work for what we are doing and things might need to be adjusted lest you get frustrated that your character seems useless most of the time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The follow guidelines are for <strong>Abomination Vaults</strong>. This will change when we switch between Adventure Paths. So remember to check what adventure this is for.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Ancestry</span>: Do not play an ancestry that is anti group. Such as the skeleton who can not be healed, stabalized, or revived by others. If you wish to play an ancestry above common rarity please consult me first.</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Heritage</span>: There are also no restrictions on heritages, but please talk with me if you want to go with something above common.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Backgrounds</span>:  When picking your background the best choices for Abomination Vaults are acolyte, bounty hunter, farmhand, field medic, guard, hunter, martial disciple, miner, nomad, or scout. Everything is fine, just not optimal. There are adventure exclusive ones in the PDF I provide. As always please talk with me if you want to go with more rare backgrounds.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Class</span>: There are no restrictions with classes. However, Abomination Vaults is meant to be a dungeon crawl. Classes who excel at diplomacy or deception will not find a lot of use. Classes that also depend on lots of downtime between adventures will also struggle with the non stop dungeon crawling. The best class to play will be a cleric. There is no worse class, but some will excel better than others like fighters, rangers, rogues, wizards, and champions.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Attributes</span>: We will be using the system as outlined within the Core Rulebook. There are the optional flaws. Those are for you to choose if you want to use them, they are not a variant rule.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Skills</span>: Again, skills that focus on things like diplomacy, deception, or lying will find little use. While the most useful skills will be religion, occultism, and society for recall knowledge. Theivery and athletics will be the most used skills while exploring. The best Lore skills include Cavern Lore, Otari Lore, and Spirit Lore, but many other Lore skills might come into play.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Feats</span>: Going back to the guidelines of ancestry and heritages. Try to stick with common feats. If you wish to go with something above common please talk with me about it. Canny Acumen, Incredible Initiative, and Toughness are all useful.
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Languages</span>: You are going to be delving deep into old forgotten ruins. Who knows what you will find inside! Well I do, and I can tell you very few of them talk common. The most useful languages will be Aklo, Elven, Draconic, and Undercommon. If you hope to communicate with the denizens of the dungeon consider taking one of these.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Alignment</span>: No evil characters. This means no evil alignments at all. It also excludes using Chaotic Neutral as an excuse to be evil.
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Deities</span>: Even if you call them a god or religion, do not worship evil deities that task their followers with evil deeds. The deities you should not worship in this adventure fall under the evil category. If you want a religious connection to the adventure two good choices are Cosmic Caravan and Gozreh.
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
                    <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Equipment</span>: The expectation of gear in PF2e is that you start with common gear. At level 1 you pick gear level 0 and start with 15gp to spend. If you wish to start with gear above common please consult me on the desire. You can find the following guidelines and rules for making higher level characters on <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=587" target="_blank">Archive of Nethys here</a>.
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Damage Types</span>: In Abomination Vaults there is a lot of resistances to poison damage. So it is highly suggested to avoid this as a type of damage, or at least as a main damage type. While on the other hand positive damage will be very useful in the upcoming adventure. Also there are creatures immune to all physical damage (this is different from “only physical damage from non magical weapons”) and all magical damage. They are rare enough that you don't need to build a character around these concepts, but having some type of backup damage would be useful.</p>            
          </li>
          
        </ul>

        <p>Remember characters are made at session 0. Feel free to show up with some ideas and rough outlines, but making our characters together ensures good group harmony and is just a lot of fun. Also please be in communication with me on what you want to do. One of my many jobs is to help you build your characters and I am always willing to help in this task. I rarely say no to things, unless I think the choice is too disruptive or too outrageous for the campaign.</p>
