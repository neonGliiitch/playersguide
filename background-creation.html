        <p>Let's get creative!</p>
        <br>
        <p>The purpose of this section of the website is to help you build a character who will have skin in the adventure ahead. Character's should be made with the goal of being connected to the adventure path and party. Making a character that ties into the story, has a reason for going on the adventure, and that works well with the group will ensure everyone has fun and the group accomplishes their tasks. This is the difference between a group that fizzles out in 5 sessions, and one that sees the campaign through to fruition.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The following are guidelines on how to create a group oriented, adventure focused, and NPC connected character. You are free to design your backstory however you wish but <i>please</i> try to have some elements of the following in your background.</p>
        <br>
        <p> These guidelines are general and should never change between adventures.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Group Oriented</span>: When making a character you should instill in them some kind of desire to be part of the group. Characters shouldn't be lone wolves who don't know why they're here, who constantly bicker with everyone, and don’t want to work with party members.</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Team Work</span>: Your character should be a good team player. This means discussing plans, sharing information, working to achieve the same results, getting along, and so forth. A character shouldn’t constantly do their own thing above the desires of the group, and always put everyone in bad situations.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Group Familiarity</span>: We are not starting the adventure as strangers meeting for the first time. Your characters should know each other in some fashion. Either they know each other because of an acquaintance, they have worked together before, they have seen each other around town, or they are good friends who have known each other for a long time. Your reason why you’re familiar with each other is up to you, but you should know each other.</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Backgrounds</span>: When you designed your character, you should have picked a background. This background should connect with your character. If you took the farmer background, you should include being a farmer in your backstory and have traits and quirks that come from this previous lifestyle.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Level Appropriate</span>: When writing your backstory you should consider your level and what that means about your character. A level 1 character has yet to go on grand adventures, they have yet to kill dragons, they hardly know anything about the world. Meanwhile a level 10 should have some achievements to boast about and have some wisdom learned from their time adventuring that they can lean upon.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">You're The Hero</span>: There is nothing wrong with building a character who has yet to find their place in life. They may be young, inexperienced, or struggling to find their way. That said, your character should want to do good, they should want to save and help people, they should despise evil monsters. The end goal is that you do become the hero of stories told for generations to come.
            </p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Character Growth</span>: Your character should have some room to grow, and their backstory should be built with this in mind. Challenges, situations, and people should change them. This style of storytelling is often referred to in writing as the hero's journey. Build your character to grow, learn, and become better.</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">NPC Connections</span>: Your character should have a connection to an NPC in the story. In the Adventure Setting section of the website I give all the information needed for the upcoming adventure. This also includes a list of commonly known NPCs, and includes an important NPC you should already know. Your character should have a connection to the important NPC, and picking another NPC from the town to be connected to will also give you a strong anchor in the Adventure Path.</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Location Ties</span>: Every Adventure Path we play takes place somewhere. Your character is in this location. Usually in the Adventure Setting section of the website I list some reasons why you know the important NPC of the adventure. However, you should have some connection to the location. Why did you come here? What is your goal here? Is this your home town? Why are you still here?</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">In Depth</span>: Last, but not least, you should have a well flushed out back story. It doesn't have to be paragraphs long and written out as a novel. A simple list of questions with answers is more than enough to have an in depth backstory. The importance of an in depth backstory is it better helps you roleplay your character, but it also gives me the DM material to work from later on down the road when I want to pull your character personally into the story. In fact I have a sheet I use when building my own characters <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR6hkGTQ-K4G7dZgT1u54E6GNOQeuBnrPP5IvFWdiNXqPpoeRjr5-OuEnWfemLLJGmBsewO_k2iMG3d/pub" target="_blank">here</a> that you are free to use yourself</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These guidelines are meant to help you create a flushed out character. The first benefit of this is that your character is connected to the adventure. A connected character is vastly more fun and feels less disjointed. This can really make or break sessions for the players, and I have seen the side effect first hand of players trying to force characters with totally different motives and goals into the same group.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second benefit is that your character will mesh well with the group. Aside from having totally different goals, there’s nothing that will drag a session to a halt and derail things like characters who don’t get along at all. Building characters who work well together from the start, avoid these pitfalls.</p>
