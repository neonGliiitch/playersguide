        <p>Time to get those creative jucies flowing!</p>
        <br>
        <p>The purpose of this section of the website is to help you build a character that will connect to the game ahead. Character's should be made with the goal of being connected to the adventure path. Having a character that ties into the story, has a reason for going on the adventure, that works well with the group, and over all brings success to the group.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The following is guidelines on how to create a group oriented, adventured focused, and NPC connected character. You are free to have any background you wish but <i>please</i> try to have some elements of the following in your background.</p>
        <br>
        <p> These guidelines are general and should never change between adventures.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Group Oriented</span>: When making a character you should instill in them some kind of desire to be part of the group. Characters shouldn't be loan rangers who don't know why they're here.</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Team Work</span>: Your character should be a good team player. This means discussing plans, sharing information, working to achieve the same results, getting along, and so forth. A character should do his own thing above the desires of the group and constantly put everyone in bad situations.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Backgrounds</span>: When you designed your character you should of picked a background. This backstory should connect with your character. If you took the farmer background, you should include being a farmer in your own written background and have traits and quirks that come from this previous lifestlye.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Level Appropiate</span>: When writing your backgstory you should do so from the aspect of your level. A level one has yet to go on grand adventures, they have yet to kill goblins, they hardly know anything about the world. Meanwhile a level 10 should have some achievements to boast about and has some wisdom learned from their time adventuring.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">You're The Hero</span>: There is nothing wrong with building a character who has yet to find their place in life. They may be young, inexperienced, or struggling to find their way. That said, your character should want to do good, they should want to save and help people, they should dispise evil monsters. The end goal, is that you do become the hero of the story told for generations to come.</p>            
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Character Growth</span>: Your character should have some room to grow, and their backstory should be built with this in mind. Challenges, situations, and people should changed them. This style of story telling is often refered to in writing as the heroes journey. Build your character to grow, learn, and become better.</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">NPC Connections</span>: Your character should have a connection to an NPC in the story. In the Adventure Setting section of the website I give all the information needed for the upcoming adventure. This also includes a list of commonly known NPCs, and includes an important NPC you should already know. Your character should have a connection to the important NPC, and picking another NPC from the town to be connected to will also give you a strong anchor in the Adventure Path.</p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">Location Ties</span>: Every Adventure Path we play takes place somewhere. Your character is in this location. Usually in the Adventure Setting section of the website I list some reasons why you know the important NPC of the adventure. However, you should have some connection to the location. Why did you come here? What is your goal here? Is this your home town? Why are you still here? </p>
          </li>
          <hr class="ui-hr">
          <li>
            <p><span class="content-bold">In Depth</span>: Last, but not least, you should have a well flush out back story. It doesn't have to be paragprahs long and written out as a novel. A simple list of question with answers is more than enough to have an in depth backstory. The importance of an indepth backstory is it better helps you roleplay your character, but it also gives me the DM material to work from later on down the road when I want to pull your character personally into the story. In fact I have a sheet I use when building my own characters <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PhUPiD7i_LFQgfdrqJ8Kop0N0X7MjK1ZQ7sm0frTjZ8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> here that you are free to use yourself</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using the above guidelines will help create a character who fits into the story, who works well with the group, and isn't disruptive and determental to the group as a whole. Player creativity and freedom is highly encouraged when coming up with your backstory, but remember we are all here to have fun. Making a character that fits into the adventure will help us stay focused on this goal.</p>
